"""md_doc — shared, framework-agnostic markdown-structure logic.

This module is the single source of truth for turning markdown text into a
navigable *document structure* — a tree of heading (and optionally list-item)
nodes — plus the cross-document plumbing both ``browse-md`` and
``browse-claude`` need: reference detection/resolution between ``.md`` files,
the cheap heading-detection gate, and a process-wide parse cache.

It deliberately knows nothing about ``browse_tui`` / ``Item``: it returns plain
structural ``MdNode`` dataclasses, and each recipe maps those onto its own
``Item``/id space, tags, and styling. That keeps the markdown logic unit-testable
in isolation and decoupled from the TUI framework. ``browse-md`` and
``browse-claude`` import THIS module; it never imports them.

The heading/list tree builder is ``browse-md``'s ``_build_nodes`` generalised
and lifted out: same ``md2ansi_scan`` source-of-truth scan, same line/byte
indexing, same boundary rule, same two-stack nesting — minus the ``Item``
construction and id/anchor bookkeeping, which now live in the recipes.

A note on "byte": the offsets here (``byte_offset`` / ``byte_size``) are
character offsets into the decoded ``str`` text — exactly what
``md2ansi_scan`` reports and what callers slice with
(``text[byte_offset : byte_offset + byte_size]``). The name is kept for
continuity with ``browse-md``'s field names and the design spec; for pure-ASCII
markdown (the common case) chars and bytes coincide.

@dataclass(slots=True)
class MdNode:
    """One node in a document's heading/list structure.

    Plain data, no ``Item`` coupling — recipes map these onto their own row
    types. Fields:

      * ``kind``        — ``'heading'``, ``'list-item'``, or ``'text'`` (a dim
                          run of body text preceding a scope's first heading,
                          synthesised by ``build_doc_tree`` when lists are off).
      * ``level``       — heading level (1..6) or list indent level (0-based).
                          A ``'text'`` node borrows the level of the first
                          heading it precedes (so it renders alongside it).
      * ``title``       — the row label: for headings/list-items the source
                          line with the leading sigil stripped (``##``/``-``/
                          ``1.`` + following whitespace) but inline markup
                          (``**bold**``) preserved, matching ``browse-md``'s
                          tree-row titles. For a ``'text'`` node it is the run's
                          first non-blank line, ``.strip()``-ed (markup kept).
      * ``line_offset`` — 0-based line number of the node within the document.
      * ``byte_offset`` — character offset of the node's start in the text.
      * ``byte_size``   — character length of the node's section, per the
                          boundary rule (start of this node to the start of the
                          next sibling-or-shallower node, or EOF). Slicing
                          ``text[byte_offset : byte_offset + byte_size]`` yields
                          the node's full section including descendants. For a
                          ``'text'`` node the section is the body run itself —
                          from its first non-blank line to the start of the
                          heading it precedes.
      * ``children``    — nested ``MdNode``s (sub-headings; list children).
                          Always empty for a ``'text'`` node.

    Returns a list of top-level ``MdNode``s in document order, each with its
    nested children populated. There is NO synthetic file root — that wrapper
    belongs to each recipe's id/Item space, not to the shared structure. A
    document with no headings (and, when ``include_lists`` is off, regardless
    of its list content) yields ``[]``.

    ``include_lists=False`` (the default) scans headings only — the
    table-of-contents view ``browse-claude`` always wants. ``True`` adds
    list-item nodes (``browse-md``'s ``-l`` flag); the heading nodes are
    byte-for-byte identical either way because ``md2ansi_scan`` runs the full
    grammar internally and only filters at yield time.

    This is ``browse-md``'s ``_build_nodes`` generalised and lifted out, minus
    its ``Item`` construction and ``by_id``/``by_line`` indexing. Passes:

      1. Per-event ``MdNode`` construction (heading kinds → ``'heading'``
         nodes, ``ul``/``ol`` → ``'list-item'`` nodes), with the title sigil
         stripped. ``byte_size`` is filled by pass 2.
      2. Boundary rule (single linear pass): for node ``i``, find the next
         node ``j`` that is sibling-or-shallower and set ``byte_size =
         nodes[j].byte_offset - nodes[i].byte_offset`` (EOF → ``len(text)``).
         For a heading, ``j`` is the next heading at level ≤ L (lists never
         close a heading scope). For a list item, ``j`` is the next list item
         at indent ≤ L, OR any heading (a heading boundary always resets list
         scope).
      3. Tree linking via two stacks. The heading stack pops on level-≥
         comparisons (so an h3 attaches under the nearest open h1/h2). The
         list stack mirrors that on indent and resets on every heading
         boundary; an orphan list item (no shallower list ancestor) attaches
         to the surrounding heading, else becomes a top-level node.
      4. Leading body-text nodes (only when ``include_lists`` is off): for each
         scope with >=1 heading child, the body run before its first heading
         becomes a dim ``'text'`` node inserted as the scope's first child (see
         ``_add_text_nodes``). With lists on this pass is skipped, so the
         with-lists tree is byte-for-byte unchanged.

# (``Ctrl-R`` / ``_bust_caches_for``) via ``clear_cache``. Headings-only is the
# cached shape — it is what both recipes' reference-following uses; a caller
# that needs lists (``browse-md``'s ``-l`` over its primary files) builds those
# trees itself rather than polluting this shared cache with a second variant.
